# Object Detection React App

This is a try to create an object detection react app. I used pretrained
 model available on tensorflow website. I used [Object Detection (coco-ssd)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow-models/coco-ssd)
 model trained on Coco dataset which is a large-scale object detection, 
 segmentation, and captioning dataset.The Pretrained model is capable of detecting 80 classes of objects.
